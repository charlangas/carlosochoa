I'm currently doing growth marketing at <a href="https://www.storyswag.co" target="_blank">Story Swag</a>, an amazing iOS app that allows anyone to create gorgeous slideshows using your own videos and photos. I like to think about it like a Canva for video.

I believe in learning by doing, so I'm on a mission to launch a new side project for every new skill I want to try out.

So far I've launched:
- <a href="https://www.fastforwarder.co" target="_blank">FastForwarder</a>, to learn the skills of an SDR.
- <a href="https://www.homewellmaid.com" target="_blank">Home Well Services</a> to learn about the domestic services industry.
- <a href="https://www.leveragewise.ai" target="_blank">LeverageWise</a> to learn about newsletters as a business.
- <a href="https://chia.supply" target="_blank">Chia Supply</a> to learn about an emerging cryptocurrency and put my SEO skills to work.
